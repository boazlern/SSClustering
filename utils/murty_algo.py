# No copying and pasting of online code was performed, though some code may turn out to be similar due to the standardized nature of this algorithm.
# This is a very different implementation due to the fact that it heavily uses numpy, vastly simplifies many poorly pythonized coding elements
# removes the "class" approach for a function based one. Etc.
# Improvements that need to be made is to require the matrix class, and to vectorize iterations through the matrix.
